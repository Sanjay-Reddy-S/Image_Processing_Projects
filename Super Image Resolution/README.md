# Super_Resolution_Of_Images

The models were built in Keras, using the architecture described in the paper. Few results are also uploaded. 

Given a training set, each image is first downgraded (Used OpenCV libraries in Python for this task) and
then a CNN is trained using low quality images as input and high quality images as output.
